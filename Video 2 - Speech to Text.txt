[SPEAKER_00] 0:00 - 0:05
 Well, hello there. How's it going everybody? Today we're gonna go over my 50 Cloud Code tips.

[SPEAKER_00] 0:06 - 0:11
 I've been working with Cloud Code basically every day for about six months now and I feel like I've

[SPEAKER_00] 0:11 - 0:18
 learned a ton of things and yes I am one of those engineers that are basically not writing code

[SPEAKER_00] 0:18 - 0:24
 anymore. I'm still in Cloud Code like 12 hours a day actively pair programming with Cloud Code

[SPEAKER_00] 0:24 - 0:29
 basically and reviewing a ton of code. I still read every single line of code. That's actually

[SPEAKER_00] 0:29 - 0:35
 my biggest bottleneck right now, the reviewing of the code. But I thought it would be great to show

[SPEAKER_00] 0:35 - 0:40
 you kind of the best tips that I've learned along the way and these are kind of tips that I wish I

[SPEAKER_00] 0:40 - 0:44
 knew when I was first getting started. We're gonna start off with some foundation stuff like setting

[SPEAKER_00] 0:44 - 0:50
 up, very quick setup stuff, a little bit about like cloud.md rules like what you should put in,

[SPEAKER_00] 0:50 - 0:55
 what you should think about, and kind of some of the advanced stuff for later. But without further

[SPEAKER_00] 0:55 - 1:01
 ado, let's dive into 50 Cloud Code tips. So I got my terminal here and I just have some slides behind

[SPEAKER_00] 1:01 - 1:07
 to tell you guys what I'm doing. So here is the foundations that I mentioned. We're gonna cover

[SPEAKER_00] 1:07 - 1:14
 getting started, keyboard shortcuts, some essential like slash commands, and a little bit of a deep dive

[SPEAKER_00] 1:14 - 1:21
 into the cloud.md. So let's get started. All right, so for tip number one, you want to run Cloud Code

[SPEAKER_00] 1:21 - 1:27
 in your root directory of whatever project you're working on. So for example, I have this Pomodoro

[SPEAKER_00] 1:27 - 1:33
 app that I'm like kind of been working on. So I'll type in like Cloud here. And that's essentially how

[SPEAKER_00] 1:33 - 1:38
 you get started. And you really want to do this because later we'll talk about this. But if you

[SPEAKER_00] 1:38 - 1:44
 have rule files or any kind of setup, the initial root directory is where Cloud is going to zip up the

[SPEAKER_00] 1:44 - 1:50
 context into that first token. So if you ever wonder why you had a bunch of tokens used, even though you

[SPEAKER_00] 1:50 - 1:55
 just opened up Cloud, this is probably the reason why it's because Cloud is getting your project ready.

[SPEAKER_00] 1:55 - 2:01
 All right, so one of the first things that you want to do is run slash init, like that. And what this

[SPEAKER_00] 2:01 - 2:07
 does is Cloud will go and look at your code base and do an analysis of your code base, and then create

[SPEAKER_00] 2:07 - 2:15
 that initial cloud.md file in the dot cloud directory of your code base. Now, there is like different

[SPEAKER_00] 2:15 - 2:19
 directories that you could source from, like you could have a global one or like this one. But yeah,

[SPEAKER_00] 2:19 - 2:24
 at a high level, what this is doing right now is just it's just looking at the code base, looking

[SPEAKER_00] 2:24 - 2:30
 for the architecture, and then basically it's creating that Cloud that empty. All right, so it

[SPEAKER_00] 2:30 - 2:36
 just finished, it does take some time. And as you can see, it's kind of going and saying, oh, this is,

[SPEAKER_00] 2:36 - 2:43
 this is like a next JS 15 app. It's like a portfolio site. But yeah, it's just going over high level things

[SPEAKER_00] 2:43 - 2:50
 about this particular project. And then you could just essentially hit yes, to commit that to your

[SPEAKER_00] 2:50 - 2:55
 dot cloud. So this is like really important for new projects. So I highly recommend you to run it.

[SPEAKER_00] 2:55 - 3:01
 All right, so the tip number two is that cloud.md file that we just created, it kind of runs on the

[SPEAKER_00] 3:01 - 3:07
 hierarchy. So if you go to memory slash memory, you could kind of see right here that there is a

[SPEAKER_00] 3:07 - 3:11
 checked in memory, which is the current root directory. And then there's a user memory, this is like your

[SPEAKER_00] 3:11 - 3:18
 global one. So that's like in your tilde dot cloud slash cloud. So you could kind of choose between

[SPEAKER_00] 3:18 - 3:24
 it, but it's really there. So you can know what the core rule that the cloud code is operating on

[SPEAKER_00] 3:24 - 3:30
 right now, looking at the cloud.md that we call just created, like this is a pretty good one to get

[SPEAKER_00] 3:30 - 3:35
 started, right? It just has like, you don't want it to be too large, it's like very small, right? I think

[SPEAKER_00] 3:35 - 3:42
 around 300 lines is about a decent place that you want to aim for. And to be honest, going larger is

[SPEAKER_00] 3:42 - 3:48
 fine. But just remember that every time you increase that initial context window, you're going to use

[SPEAKER_00] 3:48 - 3:54
 more tokens, first of all, but also the more bloat you have in your context, the less likely the AI will

[SPEAKER_00] 3:54 - 4:00
 do exactly what you're trying to do. All right, so for structure and what you should be thinking about

[SPEAKER_00] 4:00 - 4:07
 putting into your cloud.md, I just opened another project, this one is my anime Pomodoro. This is an

[SPEAKER_00] 4:07 - 4:14
 iOS app. So I wanted to show you a little bit more examples. But basically, the things I like to put is

[SPEAKER_00] 4:14 - 4:19
 like high level technical architecture and the requirements, you know, like what is the project,

[SPEAKER_00] 4:19 - 4:24
 like that's kind of important. And then you want to give it like some domain context, right? Like, oh,

[SPEAKER_00] 4:24 - 4:31
 it's using Swift UI. And I probably would add high level architecture and like kind of the file path

[SPEAKER_00] 4:31 - 4:36
 and things like that. And just some of the high level design patterns, like you'll see, like all of

[SPEAKER_00] 4:36 - 4:43
 that should go in here. And then one of the important thing is kind of having your build flow,

[SPEAKER_00] 4:43 - 4:49
 like your validation flow. And this is like kind of where my build and validation is. So you can see that

[SPEAKER_00] 4:49 - 4:53
 I'll like build the xcode and then build a project and make sure things compile,

[SPEAKER_00] 4:53 - 4:59
 just having this loop of validation is so amazing, because the AI will just be able to self improve

[SPEAKER_00] 5:00 - 5:07
 and keep going until it fixes itself. So like, if you're ever in that situation where you just like,

[SPEAKER_00] 5:07 - 5:13
 ask cursor to do something or ask some AI code agent to do something, and it just doesn't work,

[SPEAKER_00] 5:13 - 5:19
 a lot of that gets resolved when you fix the validation. And validation, I think as a side tip,

[SPEAKER_00] 5:19 - 5:23
 is probably one of the most important topics that you should really think about when you're

[SPEAKER_00] 5:23 - 5:30
 thinking about trying to build good AI agentic like coding systems or any workflows is really,

[SPEAKER_00] 5:31 - 5:37
 what is the validation loop, because that will dramatically improve how good your AI will be.

[SPEAKER_00] 5:37 - 5:43
 All right, so let's go to some keyboard shortcuts. And the reason why I even have this entire section

[SPEAKER_00] 5:43 - 5:50
 for this is because if you're going to be in cloud code all day, every day, like if you're an engineer,

[SPEAKER_00] 5:50 - 5:56
 you're just going to be on this workhorse for quite a while. So you should learn how to actually use

[SPEAKER_00] 5:56 - 6:04
 most useful hotkeys. And there's essentially shift tab toggle modes is pretty useful. And that's just

[SPEAKER_00] 6:04 - 6:09
 like hitting shift and tab. And then you can see right here that we're switching from accept edits to

[SPEAKER_00] 6:09 - 6:17
 plan mode. I actually use plan mode quite heavily. I think I use plan mode almost exclusively whenever I

[SPEAKER_00] 6:17 - 6:23
 start a new feature, it's rare that I start in edit mode, I always just want to verify and double check

[SPEAKER_00] 6:23 - 6:28
 that my assumptions about the code base that I'm working on. And the direction that I'm trying to

[SPEAKER_00] 6:28 - 6:35
 go with is the best option. So I usually start in plan mode and spend a decent amount of time before I go

[SPEAKER_00] 6:35 - 6:42
 to accept and just like start execution. All right, escape interrupts. Let me just get something started

[SPEAKER_00] 6:42 - 6:49
 here. Tell me a good way to plan a live activity for when I background the app. Okay, so I'm gonna

[SPEAKER_00] 6:49 - 6:56
 let this go to show you guys what escaping the interrupts is. But you can see that Claude is like

[SPEAKER_00] 6:56 - 7:02
 thinking here and it's like going through and doing things. Sometimes if especially during plan mode, you

[SPEAKER_00] 7:02 - 7:08
 want to kind of like look at this and look at the thinking and see if it's going off track. If it is, you

[SPEAKER_00] 7:08 - 7:13
 just hit escape. And then it interrupts. Now a lot of people might be like kind of like scared to

[SPEAKER_00] 7:13 - 7:19
 interrupt it. But you can just like hit up and then go right back to where you're doing. Or you

[SPEAKER_00] 7:19 - 7:25
 could just interrupt it and tell it something else. The whole point is Claude code has a really good way

[SPEAKER_00] 7:25 - 7:32
 of like deduping and entering prompts in a nice queue and like it logically knows what to do. So you don't

[SPEAKER_00] 7:32 - 7:39
 have to be so scared to like enter more than one prompt and also like escaping early and interrupting

[SPEAKER_00] 7:39 - 7:44
 and changing course. Like it's actually recommended to do that. Tip number eight is if you ever had

[SPEAKER_00] 7:44 - 7:48
 something like really big where you copy pasted something and you're like, Oh, I don't want to

[SPEAKER_00] 7:48 - 7:55
 delete everything. A handy shortcut here is just double tap escape and it'll clear the input. There's also

[SPEAKER_00] 7:55 - 8:00
 a Vim mode if you're into that, but I use this all the time. Another thing is when you're on an empty

[SPEAKER_00] 8:00 - 8:07
 input, if you double tap escape, you'll see that you can rewind to like a previous point, and then

[SPEAKER_00] 8:07 - 8:13
 restore that context point. This is kind of common with clock code. But a lot of the tools I feel like

[SPEAKER_00] 8:13 - 8:19
 is really built to manage your context and context engineering. And then there's just like an agent that

[SPEAKER_00] 8:19 - 8:24
 is wrapped around the orchestration. But a lot of the like slash commands and stuff that we'll be going

[SPEAKER_00] 8:24 - 8:30
 over, I feel like it's it's really to manage that context window. All right, screenshots is

[SPEAKER_00] 8:30 - 8:36
 obviously a pretty common thing to do. There's a lot of ways to do it. But you can essentially

[SPEAKER_00] 8:36 - 8:43
 take a screenshot and then drag it over and just drop it in. And then obviously, another good tip

[SPEAKER_00] 8:43 - 8:49
 is to add context. This is a cool picture of the clock home mascot. Do something with it. I don't know.

[SPEAKER_00] 8:50 - 8:56
 But yeah, so that's a really good example of like taking a screenshot and bringing it over. If you are

[SPEAKER_00] 8:56 - 9:01
 doing any kind of UI work, you'll definitely use this workflow. I also highly recommend finding like

[SPEAKER_00] 9:01 - 9:09
 a Figma MCP or some form of MCP that works really good with the specific validation that you're trying

[SPEAKER_00] 9:09 - 9:14
 to do. All right, moving on to essential commands. And this is slash commands. Before I end on the

[SPEAKER_00] 9:14 - 9:19
 keyboard shortcuts, there's a lot more keyboard shortcuts, things that I don't use all the time.

[SPEAKER_00] 9:19 - 9:23
 If you just go to like slash help, you'll be able to see a bunch of them. But the ones that I covered,

[SPEAKER_00] 9:23 - 9:29
 I use all the time every day. So definitely just memorize it, I think it would be really useful.

[SPEAKER_00] 9:29 - 9:35
 Now essential commands is like the slash commands that I think you should know about. There's way more

[SPEAKER_00] 9:35 - 9:40
 slash commands. And you could like make your own slash commands. But these are the ones that I think

[SPEAKER_00] 9:40 - 9:48
 is useful. All right, so slash clear is basically a way to clear the context. Now you could actually do

[SPEAKER_00] 9:48 - 9:53
 this by just creating another instance of Claude, right? That's basically the same thing.

[SPEAKER_00] 9:53 - 9:59
 But if you don't want to like do that, you could just clear the context. And this is really good

[SPEAKER_00] 9:59 - 10:02
 if you want to start a new feature and you're completely done with the old task,

[SPEAKER_00] 10:02 - 10:12
 and you don't want the old context to

[SPEAKER_00] 10:04 - 10:08
 blow up the new context and influence the new project that you're doing.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:08 - 10:10
 All right, so I just loaded some stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:10 - 10:12
 Let's go into slash context.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:13 - 10:19
 What this does is it will give you like a visual representation of the current context

[SPEAKER_00] 10:19 - 10:22
 that Cloud Code is operating in.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:22 - 10:24
 Now, why is this useful?

[SPEAKER_00] 10:24 - 10:31
 So the main reason why this is useful is because it gives you an opportunity to reason about

[SPEAKER_00] 10:31 - 10:36
 the context that Cloud Code is making assumptions on on your code base.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:36 - 10:40
 Now, I always say context is best served fresh and condensed.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:40 - 10:44
 And you really want to take a look at this from time to time.

[SPEAKER_00] 10:44 - 10:49
 If you ever felt like Cloud Code has regressed and like things are not working the way it

[SPEAKER_00] 10:49 - 10:54
 is or your like cost and usage like bill is going up, you really want to look at this

[SPEAKER_00] 10:54 - 10:58
 and then see which are like the most biggest offenders, right?

[SPEAKER_00] 10:58 - 11:00
 You just want to like audit it.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:00 - 11:04
 Like MCPs are one of those very common things that blows up your tokens.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:04 - 11:10
 I mean, like look at all of this Xcode related MCPs and every time it runs it like, I mean,

[SPEAKER_00] 11:10 - 11:14
 these are not a lot because I haven't been doing that much in this particular workflow,

[SPEAKER_00] 11:14 - 11:20
 but you could just imagine that once I start doing those iteration cycles, this like usage

[SPEAKER_00] 11:20 - 11:21
 will like blow up.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:21 - 11:25
 But yeah, so if you look at this and you're like, oh, this MCP is using so much, then you

[SPEAKER_00] 11:25 - 11:28
 could remove it or just disable it for this directory.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:28 - 11:31
 So slash context is something that you probably should not ignore.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:31 - 11:37
 Again, I think Cloud Code, all of the tools is really there to manage a lot of the context

[SPEAKER_00] 11:37 - 11:39
 and doing really good context engineering.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:39 - 11:41
 So this is a good slash command.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:41 - 11:41
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:41 - 11:46
 So in terms of compaction, like if you use Cloud Code at all, if you had a long session,

[SPEAKER_00] 11:46 - 11:49
 it will start auto compacting at some point.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:49 - 11:54
 All auto compaction does is it takes your current context window, like context that you created,

[SPEAKER_00] 11:54 - 11:56
 and then it will just summarize it.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:56 - 11:58
 And then it does a pretty good job.

[SPEAKER_00] 11:58 - 12:01
 For my projects, I usually just let the auto compaction work.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:02 - 12:06
 But if you really want to compact what you have right now, you could just compact.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:06 - 12:08
 But I rarely use this.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:08 - 12:15
 The only time I use this is if I want to save some version of my context into like my local,

[SPEAKER_00] 12:15 - 12:18
 like second brain, if you haven't seen that video, go and check it out.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:18 - 12:21
 But I have the second brain concept when I work on projects.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:21 - 12:22
 And that's where that goes.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:22 - 12:26
 So for slash models, this is like very useful.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:26 - 12:30
 I think if you have unlimited tokens, like if you're doing this at work, for me,

[SPEAKER_00] 12:30 - 12:34
 I usually just defaulted to Opus 4.5.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:34 - 12:39
 But if you're very like cost sensitive, and you know, certain workflows work well in Sonnet,

[SPEAKER_00] 12:39 - 12:43
 or like haiku, then you could just go and change that.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:43 - 12:45
 Keeping it at default is fine too.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:45 - 12:48
 But I would try to use Opus as much as possible.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:48 - 12:48
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:48 - 12:50
 So slash resume is really useful.

[SPEAKER_00] 12:50 - 12:55
 If you accidentally like lost your instance, let's say you created another one,

[SPEAKER_00] 12:55 - 12:59
 and then you accidentally killed it or something like that, right?

[SPEAKER_00] 13:00 - 13:02
 Oh, you killed the wrong one or something.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:02 - 13:07
 Then when you go back into clock code, you could do slash resume, like so.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:07 - 13:11
 And then it'll give you kind of the old context.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:11 - 13:16
 And then you could like recover your context so that you don't lose the all the work that

[SPEAKER_00] 13:16 - 13:18
 you did in building up that context window.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:18 - 13:18
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:19 - 13:24
 Slash MCP is really about showing the MCPs that you have installed.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:25 - 13:32
 If I have to be honest, I try very, very hard to not use MCPs, because I think they blow up

[SPEAKER_00] 13:32 - 13:33
 your context window.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:33 - 13:38
 So I only install ones that are needed for that very specific project.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:38 - 13:44
 And I try to just leverage cloud code and write scripts and like these kind of things manually,

[SPEAKER_00] 13:44 - 13:47
 like myself, to do the validations and things like that.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:47 - 13:53
 But some projects, you just do need MCPs, like this Xcode one, you kind of need it.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:53 - 13:58
 And for other projects, like my Next.js apps, I have like a whole set of MCPs for that.

[SPEAKER_00] 13:58 - 14:00
 But just be careful with MCPs.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:00 - 14:06
 But it's a really fantastic way to teach cloud how to do certain things, especially with like

[SPEAKER_00] 14:06 - 14:08
 third party software and things like that.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:08 - 14:09
 You know, it's a protocol, right?

[SPEAKER_00] 14:09 - 14:10
 Model context protocol.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:11 - 14:13
 So it's basically used everywhere.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:13 - 14:16
 But again, it's known to blow up your token usage and your context window.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:17 - 14:17
 So just be careful.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:18 - 14:18
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:18 - 14:22
 So slash help is the last thing I'm going to teach you, you know, teach a man how to fish.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:22 - 14:26
 So this like little wizard here will just teach you what they are and give you like descriptions

[SPEAKER_00] 14:26 - 14:27
 of everything.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:27 - 14:32
 So just go ahead and like try these out and just take a look and, you know, explore.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:32 - 14:32
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:32 - 14:34
 So the next thing is around Git.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:34 - 14:37
 So you could ask Cloud Code to manage your Git.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:37 - 14:41
 I think there's a bunch of like skills you could download to Cloud Code to manage all your

[SPEAKER_00] 14:41 - 14:41
 Git.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:42 - 14:43
 And I think that's something that you should do.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:43 - 14:49
 Like I write a lot of my summaries and test plans all using like Cloud Code now.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:49 - 14:52
 Obviously, I have my own templates that I wrote.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:52 - 14:56
 So Cloud kind of sounds more like me and it's not too verbose and things like that.

[SPEAKER_00] 14:56 - 14:59
 So I highly recommend you to use Git as a safety net.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:00 - 15:03
 There is actually a rewind feature, like I think I told you, where you could restore the

[SPEAKER_00] 15:03 - 15:04
 code and the conversation.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:04 - 15:07
 But this is a little confusing to me.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:07 - 15:08
 Like Git is just better.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:09 - 15:14
 I use this as like a last resort if I didn't have Git for a certain checkpoint.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:14 - 15:19
 So now that you know how to just navigate around Cloud Code and things like that, and

[SPEAKER_00] 15:19 - 15:24
 just kind of high level important like commands and things like that, I think it's a good time

[SPEAKER_00] 15:24 - 15:27
 to deep dive into the cloud.md file.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:27 - 15:37
 I think for most people, most users, like 80% of users, if you just have a really good

[SPEAKER_00] 15:37 - 15:43
 cloud.md file for your project, you could get really, really far without learning like

[SPEAKER_00] 15:43 - 15:44
 all the advanced stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:44 - 15:48
 Just having a really good rules file will save you a lot of headaches.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:48 - 15:51
 Let's kind of dive a little bit deep into this.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:51 - 15:51
 Okay.

[SPEAKER_00] 15:51 - 15:58
 So one of the most important things in the cloud.md files is first of all, it's like it

[SPEAKER_00] 15:58 - 16:02
 actually reads top to bottom and it keeps the priority from top to bottom.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:02 - 16:04
 I think that's like a very small nuance.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:04 - 16:05
 I'm pretty sure that's true.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:05 - 16:07
 I think I read that somewhere, but yeah.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:07 - 16:11
 So you want to go top to bottom as like important to least important.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:11 - 16:16
 And you want to add things that are like never do something, but always do this.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:16 - 16:19
 And they have like clear snippets of examples.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:19 - 16:20
 I think it's really good.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:20 - 16:25
 And I don't have that many on this particular project because it's stock Swift UI.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:26 - 16:30
 But the context here is that you should really think about how unique is your project?

[SPEAKER_00] 16:31 - 16:33
 How many things about your project is like homegrown?

[SPEAKER_00] 16:34 - 16:37
 And essentially like the AI may have never seen.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:37 - 16:44
 Like remember, a lot of this code is like basically a lot of the AI like coding is basically just

[SPEAKER_00] 16:44 - 16:49
 an accumulation of like the best code that the AI is trained on.

[SPEAKER_00] 16:49 - 16:57
 So it might not know your like super special DSL language that you created or like some random

[SPEAKER_00] 16:57 - 17:00
 archaic patterns that your company has.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:00 - 17:04
 And that's where you'll be like, oh, why is the AI never doing this?

[SPEAKER_00] 17:04 - 17:07
 So whenever you run into something like that, you want to fix it manually.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:07 - 17:14
 And then you just update your claw.md rules so that it never does that mistake again.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:14 - 17:16
 Think of it as like lint files kind of.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:17 - 17:21
 And then when you ask claw to update the rules, you shouldn't ever do it manually.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:22 - 17:28
 You should just go here into claw and say, hey, can you update that rule for me so we never

[SPEAKER_00] 17:28 - 17:28
 do it again?

[SPEAKER_00] 17:29 - 17:29
 Something like that.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:30 - 17:34
 Like as simple as that will go and update your claw.md files.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:34 - 17:36
 You see how it's trying to do it.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:36 - 17:39
 Obviously, there's nothing that I just did.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:39 - 17:40
 So it says nothing to add.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:41 - 17:41
 But yeah, okay.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:41 - 17:43
 It added something that I thought.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:43 - 17:45
 But you get the point.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:45 - 17:45
 All right.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:45 - 17:51
 So this next one is really around using like keywords to trigger your skills.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:51 - 17:55
 So basically, I have these like build commands inside of my rules.

[SPEAKER_00] 17:55 - 18:02
 So when I say, hey, use my Xcode MCP to build, it'll try to build the app, for example.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:02 - 18:05
 Use my Xcode MCP to build the app.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:06 - 18:12
 Okay, my whisper stuff is like failing a little bit, but maybe it'll get the gist of it from

[SPEAKER_00] 18:12 - 18:13
 build the app.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:14 - 18:17
 And as you can see, it's asking if I can use the Xcode build MCP.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:17 - 18:23
 So that's kind of the high level of like using skills and like trigger words to be able to

[SPEAKER_00] 18:23 - 18:24
 trigger certain behavior.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:24 - 18:28
 This next one is something called like compound engineering.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:28 - 18:31
 That's like kind of a new term that is being discussed.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:31 - 18:39
 But it's essentially to take your claw.md and start like committing it into the code base.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:40 - 18:45
 Now, obviously, you need to get rid of anything that's like generic for your code, like file

[SPEAKER_00] 18:45 - 18:46
 path and things like that.

[SPEAKER_00] 18:46 - 18:51
 And you also want to be mindful of how large this file becomes, right?

[SPEAKER_00] 18:51 - 18:57
 Because like I said, every time someone hits clawed in that directory or clawed trying to

[SPEAKER_00] 18:57 - 19:00
 read that directory, it will load that claw.md file.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:01 - 19:04
 So you don't want to blow up other people's context windows.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:04 - 19:08
 So you really want to be have this be like a high bar when you're committing it.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:08 - 19:14
 But the nice thing is once that's in, you essentially make that AI coding experience better for your

[SPEAKER_00] 19:14 - 19:15
 teammates.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:15 - 19:18
 But you just need to make sure that whatever you're landing is actually helping.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:18 - 19:20
 There's a lot of school of thoughts around this right now.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:20 - 19:22
 I don't think it's like completely solved.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:22 - 19:25
 But there's got to be some form of evaluations here.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:25 - 19:27
 And a lot of people are just using like vibes.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:27 - 19:30
 So you just like test it for like a few weeks.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:30 - 19:34
 And then you just try to land it and then ask for feedback, essentially.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:34 - 19:39
 So dangerously skip is essentially like clawed code in YOLO mode.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:39 - 19:45
 You know, like just basically, if you use clawed code, it will ask you to accept a bunch of stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:45 - 19:46
 It could get really annoying.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:46 - 19:52
 So a lot of people, they use clawed and then dash dash dangerously skip.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:52 - 19:58
 Okay, so it's dash dash dangerously skip permissions.

[SPEAKER_00] 19:58 - 20:03
 And when you run this, clawed code will no longer ask you.

[SPEAKER_00] 20:03 - 20:08
 essentially to accept that. I think it will completely just ignore it, except for like

[SPEAKER_00] 20:08 - 20:13
 anything you put into your slash permissions, which we'll talk about. But you only really want

[SPEAKER_00] 20:13 - 20:20
 to do this in environments that you can kind of throw away. And you're doing specific work that

[SPEAKER_00] 20:20 - 20:24
 is not like super dangerous. Like if you're going to start touching the OS and stuff like that,

[SPEAKER_00] 20:24 - 20:29
 you could really mess it up. I messed up some of my Linux machines because I was just going

[SPEAKER_00] 20:29 - 20:33
 too aggressive. And I was just testing it out. And I was trying to set up some of my Linux stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 20:33 - 20:39
 Using clock code. And then like I had to reflash the entire thing. Like I said, you can use slash

[SPEAKER_00] 20:39 - 20:47
 permissions here to kind of like tell which ones are like you still want to accept. So it does,

[SPEAKER_00] 20:47 - 20:53
 you know, like an RM dash RF or something like don't do that. Or yeah, just like mutations,

[SPEAKER_00] 20:53 - 21:00
 like just be careful with mutations, like deletion mutations, right? All right. The next big one,

[SPEAKER_00] 21:00 - 21:06
 I think now that we talked a little bit about the cloud.md rule of files, I think we should

[SPEAKER_00] 21:06 - 21:13
 talk about workflows because I have a very specific way I'd like to work and I've actually refactored

[SPEAKER_00] 21:13 - 21:20
 my entire work so that it's works with clock code. You know, I used to use cursor or like Android

[SPEAKER_00] 21:20 - 21:26
 studios mostly and VS code to do a lot of coding and stuff like that. But I dropped basically all of

[SPEAKER_00] 21:26 - 21:33
 that and I use just items now. Some people use obviously vim, but I think items is fine. So

[SPEAKER_00] 21:33 - 21:42
 I'm going to show you guys a few things. So like I said, I always start with plan mode. Let's go in

[SPEAKER_00] 21:42 - 21:46
 like plan like a little feature for this Palma de Roo app that I've been like kind of working on. I

[SPEAKER_00] 21:46 - 21:53
 actually need to remove a bunch of audio stuff. So let's just say audit my code base and make sure

[SPEAKER_00] 21:53 - 22:01
 that we're removing all of the audio playback and references to the audio of part of the Pomodoro

[SPEAKER_00] 22:01 - 22:08
 app. I always start with plan mode and I'm like iterating with cloud code. I'm arguing with it. I'm

[SPEAKER_00] 22:08 - 22:12
 having a conversation with it. You know, cloud code, you're so beautiful. You're so amazing.

[SPEAKER_00] 22:13 - 22:19
 No, but like I'm really treating it as like another like just good engineer that I'm like working with.

[SPEAKER_00] 22:19 - 22:25
 And I never just like purely accept the first answers that it gives to me. I will always kind

[SPEAKER_00] 22:25 - 22:31
 of challenging it. And I spend a lot of time and put a lot of effort at this stage of the development,

[SPEAKER_00] 22:31 - 22:38
 because I feel like once cloud code builds up that context and have good execution specs,

[SPEAKER_00] 22:38 - 22:43
 the generation of the code is actually the easy part. And I do want to take a moment and talk about

[SPEAKER_00] 22:43 - 22:51
 like kind of the news cycle about people saying, Oh, like people are no longer writing code. I think

[SPEAKER_00] 22:51 - 22:59
 like the creator of node.js said like the era of like people writing code by hand is essentially over.

[SPEAKER_00] 22:59 - 23:04
 And I actually truly believe that. And the thing is, I love like being in the zone and writing code.

[SPEAKER_00] 23:04 - 23:10
 At least I used to. The thing is, it's really hard to get back into that mode. It's like very different

[SPEAKER_00] 23:10 - 23:16
 levels of abstractions of the way you're working. And right now I'm just doing one instance of it.

[SPEAKER_00] 23:16 - 23:24
 But you could imagine just having like multiple cloud instances like this. And and then you're just

[SPEAKER_00] 23:24 - 23:30
 actively working on a bunch of different things at the same time, because you have this like new

[SPEAKER_00] 23:30 - 23:36
 superpower. The new next level of engineering is really like jumping between cloud instances,

[SPEAKER_00] 23:36 - 23:43
 and, and really context engineering, that instance, and then getting it good enough to start executing.

[SPEAKER_00] 23:43 - 23:50
 And I keep talking about this, like context, right? And this tip is really around like fresh context,

[SPEAKER_00] 23:50 - 23:56
 beats like bloated context. I think I kind of covered this throughout this. But that's why you want to

[SPEAKER_00] 23:56 - 24:02
 start with plan mode, make sure it's good. And then just go and execute instead of like having a bunch of

[SPEAKER_00] 24:02 - 24:07
 like, try this, and then try that, and then try this, and then try that, like that will just bloat

[SPEAKER_00] 24:07 - 24:13
 that context. And then the AI will get really confused at some point, because it can't remember

[SPEAKER_00] 24:13 - 24:19
 what what part of what was good and not good. So that's why you want to spend the time in the

[SPEAKER_00] 24:19 - 24:24
 beginning, building up the good context, have a good plan doc. So always has something that initially

[SPEAKER_00] 24:24 - 24:30
 was good to reference, and then it builds little by little, right? So this next one is really around

[SPEAKER_00] 24:30 - 24:38
 persisting that context. I have a full video on this about like the second brain concept. So I'll

[SPEAKER_00] 24:38 - 24:43
 link it here. But the idea here is that let's say you've finished something, you could just say,

[SPEAKER_00] 24:43 - 24:50
 save this to my local claw.md in my projects directory, save the work that we just did. So you

[SPEAKER_00] 24:50 - 24:56
 could say something like that. And then I essentially have a full workflow for this to manage this. But

[SPEAKER_00] 24:56 - 25:06
 yeah, you could do that. Load my context from my local projects. So once you have that second brain

[SPEAKER_00] 25:06 - 25:13
 concept, you could say a command like this, and it will pull that context, and then load it for your

[SPEAKER_00] 25:13 - 25:19
 new session. So here's a good example, I like to do a lot of my to do's inside of cloud code itself.

[SPEAKER_00] 25:19 - 25:24
 These are kind of the high level things that I still need to do for this next feature that I'm

[SPEAKER_00] 25:24 - 25:29
 working on. So I'm like working on a widget for this Pomodoro app. And I have like a live activity,

[SPEAKER_00] 25:29 - 25:34
 for example. And I'm also like deleting all the music stuff, because I don't think it adds value.

[SPEAKER_00] 25:35 - 25:40
 So I have a bunch of stuff that I'm tracking. But because I keep all the to do's in my local

[SPEAKER_00] 25:40 - 25:45
 index, like that I'm lazy loading, I don't always load it, I only lazy load it when I ask for it,

[SPEAKER_00] 25:45 - 25:51
 it allows me to like context switch from project to project without like carrying around like complex,

[SPEAKER_00] 25:51 - 25:56
 I don't know, Asana boards or whatever, I just keep it all in here. And it's this is this works

[SPEAKER_00] 25:56 - 26:02
 because it's my own project. But you can technically do this with like an MCP with Asana or I don't know,

[SPEAKER_00] 26:02 - 26:07
 Jira or whatever, as long as you can whatever project management that you can think of. All right,

[SPEAKER_00] 26:07 - 26:14
 so I think we covered this a little bit. But really think about the build cycle. Like, obviously,

[SPEAKER_00] 26:14 - 26:20
 if you're mobile, think about x code building the x code. But there's a lot of other workflows that you

[SPEAKER_00] 26:20 - 26:25
 could think of, like, for example, you could ask cloud code to, like, let's say you're debugging

[SPEAKER_00] 26:25 - 26:29
 something that's like kind of tricky has like race conditions or things like that, you could ask

[SPEAKER_00] 26:29 - 26:36
 cloud code to like add debug logs, for example, and then run the app and then have cloud code control

[SPEAKER_00] 26:36 - 26:41
 the emulator, you could just ask it to do that. And then like do the actions that you're trying to do

[SPEAKER_00] 26:41 - 26:47
 and then read the logs through a tail log or something, and then debug that way. Or you could use

[SPEAKER_00] 26:47 - 26:52
 like Profetto or something like that for kind of performance things, you could hook into Profetto

[SPEAKER_00] 26:52 - 26:58
 MCPs, do a run and then have a read the traces and then see if it can find jank just from like the

[SPEAKER_00] 26:58 - 27:03
 timings, right? There's just so many validation loops that you could think of, like for web,

[SPEAKER_00] 27:03 - 27:09
 you could do like puppeteer and have cloud navigated using a slash Chrome command, and then just

[SPEAKER_00] 27:09 - 27:14
 actually do the navigation or have a right just test or have like integration into an integration

[SPEAKER_00] 27:14 - 27:19
 test. You know, there's, there's a lot of things that cloud code could do. And it really is up to

[SPEAKER_00] 27:19 - 27:25
 your imagination. But it's the single most important thing, in my opinion, if you want to have a more

[SPEAKER_00] 27:25 - 27:32
 automated loop that like generates good code on like the first try. So going back to the slash models,

[SPEAKER_00] 27:32 - 27:38
 really just consider using Opus if you can afford it. It's just the best way. All of these are a little

[SPEAKER_00] 27:38 - 27:45
 bit slower. But because the way I work is I have multiple cloud instances, obviously, it's like very

[SPEAKER_00] 27:45 - 27:52
 small right in here, but I have multiple cloud instances running at all times. And then the way

[SPEAKER_00] 27:52 - 27:57
 I work is basically just juggling these cloud instances. So even if one of them takes a long

[SPEAKER_00] 27:57 - 28:03
 time, it doesn't matter because I'm like, I gave the command, and I go to the next one, I'm building

[SPEAKER_00] 28:03 - 28:10
 the context, I give a command, and I go to the other one. And then I give a command. So, so like

[SPEAKER_00] 28:10 - 28:16
 you end up like still can get into the zone, but it's like a different style. So I talked a little bit

[SPEAKER_00] 28:16 - 28:24
 about interrupting earlier. But you really want to, like look out for like assumptions or the keywords

[SPEAKER_00] 28:24 - 28:29
 are like, Oh, I'm not really sure or you'll see like errors happening. I'm having a hard time like

[SPEAKER_00] 28:29 - 28:38
 getting it to do this in this example. But just just know that like, when you go and look for the

[SPEAKER_00] 28:38 - 28:47
 best ways to delete an app, I don't know. I'm just giving it a random prompt is try to make it go off

[SPEAKER_00] 28:47 - 28:53
 course. But if you see it going and making assumptions about certain things, okay, this time

[SPEAKER_00] 28:53 - 28:58
 it didn't even because it's just new, but you should just interrupt it like that, you know, and then and

[SPEAKER_00] 28:58 - 29:03
 then just course corrected. So don't worry about course correcting. Okay, so the next section is

[SPEAKER_00] 29:03 - 29:09
 around power users, I don't really like to say power users. But most people that I've talked to

[SPEAKER_00] 29:09 - 29:15
 don't really know, like the differences between a slash command or a skill, they're kind of

[SPEAKER_00] 29:15 - 29:20
 interchangeable now. And MCPs, sub agents, you know, post hooks, pre hooks, like these kind of primitives

[SPEAKER_00] 29:20 - 29:27
 that clock code is like, known for and kind of like invented. And we're going to cover some of that and

[SPEAKER_00] 29:27 - 29:33
 and how this, these are all like composable in nature. Okay, so I call it the composability

[SPEAKER_00] 29:33 - 29:37
 framework. But it's, I just really wanted to highlight that these are composable more than

[SPEAKER_00] 29:37 - 29:43
 anything. But there's four primitive, like composable things, all the slash commands are

[SPEAKER_00] 29:43 - 29:49
 technically composable with each other, not directly each other. But anyways, so we're going to just go

[SPEAKER_00] 29:49 - 29:56
 over the fact that like, how these are composable. Okay, so let's first talk about skills. All the

[SPEAKER_00] 29:56 - 30:02
 skill is, is, it's like, you do a workflow. So let's say that I tell cloth

[SPEAKER_00] 30:02 - 30:10
 go and fetch hacker news for latest iOS news. So let's say I tell it to go and

[SPEAKER_00] 30:10 - 30:16
 fetch hacker news for the latest iOS news and then and then I tell it to save

[SPEAKER_00] 30:16 - 30:31
 that. Okay and then save a summary to my local cloud.md cloud directory. Okay I

[SPEAKER_00] 30:31 - 30:36
 misspelled that but basically let's say that it went and found some and then it's

[SPEAKER_00] 30:36 - 30:40
 save it into my local directory. Let's say I wanted to build a skill around that.

[SPEAKER_00] 30:40 - 30:45
 So you just saw me do two things. One is fetch something from a source like

[SPEAKER_00] 30:45 - 30:50
 hacker news and then save that thing to my local directory. That's technically a

[SPEAKER_00] 30:50 - 30:56
 workflow. So all you have to say do is save what we just did into a new skill

[SPEAKER_00] 30:56 - 31:01
 called fetch hacker news. And that's basically it to create a skill. It's

[SPEAKER_00] 31:01 - 31:07
 basically a recurring workflow that you can just tell Claude to remember. And

[SPEAKER_00] 31:07 - 31:13
 behind the scenes it's actually just an MD file as you can see right here. Oops. And

[SPEAKER_00] 31:13 - 31:19
 as you can see here it's literally just a system prompt. It's an MD file but Claude

[SPEAKER_00] 31:19 - 31:25
 has specific directories that is looking for skills and it will be able to infer

[SPEAKER_00] 31:25 - 31:31
 this next time I say go fetch something from hacker news or use my hacker news skill to fetch

[SPEAKER_00] 31:31 - 31:37
 articles. Yeah and then commands is basically now interchangeable. It's it's a pretty recent change

[SPEAKER_00] 31:37 - 31:44
 but you can see that skills is written to the skills documentary and it there's also now a slash

[SPEAKER_00] 31:44 - 31:49
 command called slash fetch hacker news. This is a very recent change from Anthropic where they kind of

[SPEAKER_00] 31:49 - 31:56
 like combined commands and skills. But yeah so now you can just do slash hacker news and then now it'll

[SPEAKER_00] 31:56 - 32:02
 rerun that system prompt for example. It added like an additional like assumption thing. That's pretty cool.

[SPEAKER_00] 32:02 - 32:08
 It's not exactly what I did but it kind of inferred that I would probably want that. So those are the

[SPEAKER_00] 32:08 - 32:13
 little cool things. And the thing is you could update these anytime you want. You know you could just ask

[SPEAKER_00] 32:13 - 32:21
 Claude to do something else. All right so like I said you never want to manually create these kind of

[SPEAKER_00] 32:21 - 32:29
 stuff. You want to get in the habit of asking Claude to update and manage these skills. So we could say

[SPEAKER_00] 32:29 - 32:37
 why don't you extend this fetch hacker news to fetch Twitter or Apple news. For example now sometimes it

[SPEAKER_00] 32:37 - 32:43
 won't work 100% exactly right. Okay so you see this it doesn't have Twitter authentication access.

[SPEAKER_00] 32:44 - 32:52
 So it's trying to just do some other ways. Yeah multiple sources. So you can see how it's all updating

[SPEAKER_00] 32:52 - 32:59
 that system problem that we wrote right. And then fetch hacker news and so forth. You get the idea.

[SPEAKER_00] 32:59 - 33:09
 All right so MCPs I think we covered it a little bit during the the rules but basically MCPs you just

[SPEAKER_00] 33:09 - 33:16
 want to find MCPs like this right. Like they're just model contexts. But kind of a hack is like you

[SPEAKER_00] 33:16 - 33:23
 don't actually need to search the web for an MCP. You could just be like find me a good Figma MCP. You

[SPEAKER_00] 33:23 - 33:29
 could just ask Claude to find it for you. And then most of the time it does a good job. The only thing

[SPEAKER_00] 33:29 - 33:38
 is like sometimes it's outdated. So it'll like know of one that was popular a little while ago rather

[SPEAKER_00] 33:38 - 33:42
 than doing a web search. So you just have to be mindful. And that's why I'm saying like for certain

[SPEAKER_00] 33:42 - 33:49
 actions you want to read how what it's doing and look at the thinking and then cancel it if you want to.

[SPEAKER_00] 33:49 - 33:54
 And you could have Claude also install the MCP so you don't have to like manage like the configs and

[SPEAKER_00] 33:54 - 34:01
 stuff yourself like you had to with cursor. Yeah so you could ask Claude to install the MCPs. So like

[SPEAKER_00] 34:01 - 34:06
 right here it says go and do this right. But instead I could just be like why don't you just install this

[SPEAKER_00] 34:06 - 34:14
 for me for example. And then it will just go and install it for you. All right so in terms of sub agents

[SPEAKER_00] 34:14 - 34:23
 I don't know if I have one for this. I might have like an iOS I might have one like an iOS like context

[SPEAKER_00] 34:23 - 34:34
 gathering or like architecture agent. Let me try it. So spawn a iOS architecture agent sub agent and do

[SPEAKER_00] 34:34 - 34:43
 some investigation on and on my code base and see if it's actually good or not. So you can build sub agents

[SPEAKER_00] 34:43 - 34:50
 just like you can with slash commands and skills. All you do is just ask it to make a sub agent after

[SPEAKER_00] 34:50 - 35:00
 you do the work once. The main reason why you want to create a sub agent is really to do parallel work

[SPEAKER_00] 35:00 - 35:07
 but also it's to protect your context window. So like I said one of the key features of Claude code is to

[SPEAKER_00] 35:07 - 35:14
 manage your context and do context engineering and sub agent is a huge way. And I think a lot of people

[SPEAKER_00] 35:14 - 35:20
 are using sub agents incorrectly because they do things like this where you have like an iOS

[SPEAKER_00] 35:20 - 35:26
 sub agent right by the way it's not triggering the sub agent. I'll just make one after it creates it and

[SPEAKER_00] 35:26 - 35:31
 show you guys what it looks like. It like highlights it in like a different color. But a lot of them have

[SPEAKER_00] 35:31 - 35:38
 this like workflow where they'll tell it to go do something that does the context gathering and then

[SPEAKER_00] 35:38 - 35:44
 they ask to like bring it back. But that part that portion of the context that's bringing brings back

[SPEAKER_00] 35:44 - 35:50
 from the sub agent it's only like the output it's not like how it got there. So it doesn't have the full context.

[SPEAKER_00] 35:50 - 35:57
 So for those kind of works I usually just keep it within the context window because those are the things that are really good.

[SPEAKER_00] 35:57 - 36:06
 Use what we just did to create a iOS architecture sub agent. But yeah so so oftentimes people mistake that

[SPEAKER_00] 36:06 - 36:13
 you want to like have a validator agent you want to have like a testing agent and all these kind of

[SPEAKER_00] 36:13 - 36:20
 things. But I try to keep the all the things that need that context to do its work within the same

[SPEAKER_00] 36:20 - 36:26
 cloud code session. Because like a good testing agent needs to know about the code that it wrote

[SPEAKER_00] 36:26 - 36:32
 most of the time in my opinion. Of course sometimes things could live in isolation. So what are really

[SPEAKER_00] 36:32 - 36:39
 good things for sub agents is really just like things that are atomic in nature that you want to

[SPEAKER_00] 36:39 - 36:44
 just have it run as side effects and just go and do. But yeah so that's what I use sub agents for. I don't

[SPEAKER_00] 36:44 - 36:50
 use sub agents that often. I know some people like love using them. But one of the most common like

[SPEAKER_00] 36:50 - 36:56
 clowny kind of use cases that I've seen is like CEO agent, product agent, design agent, and stuff like

[SPEAKER_00] 36:56 - 37:01
 that. And I don't really believe in that particular workflow. Like you really want to have this

[SPEAKER_00] 37:01 - 37:06
 concept of bringing the work to the context rather than trying to spread out the context that gets

[SPEAKER_00] 37:06 - 37:13
 created. All right so and this kind of ties into it like you want to avoid like having a lot of

[SPEAKER_00] 37:13 - 37:20
 instructions and overloading the context all the time. You want to keep your context condensed and fresh.

[SPEAKER_00] 37:20 - 37:26
 So that watch my video on the second brain and you like that's it'll teach you a lot about like

[SPEAKER_00] 37:26 - 37:32
 lazy loading and then having this like ongoing project domain thing that builds over time and you

[SPEAKER_00] 37:32 - 37:40
 want to essentially use that as your rag system to build like a good context and then be able to just

[SPEAKER_00] 37:40 - 37:47
 have fresh and good context all the time for your AI to execute on. All right so here is some interesting like

[SPEAKER_00] 37:48 - 37:54
 advanced workflows and I really think that the big game changer in my opinion for

[SPEAKER_00] 37:55 - 38:01
 cloud code and why I think cloud code is just so amazing is that you can do a lot of parallel

[SPEAKER_00] 38:01 - 38:08
 development. This is why I had to like fully change how I work using like terminal and stuff because

[SPEAKER_00] 38:08 - 38:14
 you could run multiple instances and I already kind of showed you guys this but you could just swap between

[SPEAKER_00] 38:14 - 38:21
 these and just have like multiple things running at the same time. So I could say start working on my

[SPEAKER_00] 38:21 - 38:27
 live activities feature so I could just have that obviously I would do it in plan mode but I'm just

[SPEAKER_00] 38:27 - 38:33
 showing you guys and then over here I could just say all right let's test out this iOS architecture and

[SPEAKER_00] 38:33 - 38:38
 and then just spawn a sub-agent. So as you can see I'm doing some investigation on one side and then I'm

[SPEAKER_00] 38:38 - 38:44
 doing live code editing but the thing is I could always just create another one go to like a

[SPEAKER_00] 38:44 - 38:50
 different project like this and then now I could be saying hey I want to work on a new newsletter

[SPEAKER_00] 38:52 - 38:59
 for example. So I could be doing a bunch of stuff all at the same time so that's like a really so

[SPEAKER_00] 38:59 - 39:04
 understanding how to juggle this and doing it effectively I think is like the next step function

[SPEAKER_00] 39:04 - 39:12
 change and I just want to kind of shout out iterms I think it's like really good because you know you

[SPEAKER_00] 39:12 - 39:18
 could do command d to create new instances like this right and then you could juggle between the

[SPEAKER_00] 39:18 - 39:26
 terminals using command the left bracket and right bracket like ignore this like slash it's like I'm just

[SPEAKER_00] 39:26 - 39:33
 saying oh it's left bracket or right bracket like slash right but yeah so and you could do that you could

[SPEAKER_00] 39:33 - 39:39
 also if you have multiple tabs like this you can actually swap between it and at work what I do is

[SPEAKER_00] 39:39 - 39:47
 I rename like what I'm doing in here like I'll say local and maybe here I'll say like remote ssh or

[SPEAKER_00] 39:47 - 39:53
 something like that and then from the remote ssh I could have cloud like running like this and I could

[SPEAKER_00] 39:53 - 40:01
 spawn them more you know and then and then I could just be going back and forth here so it really feels like

[SPEAKER_00] 40:01 - 40:07
 I'm playing Starcraft to some degree, right? And all of these I'm just doing with my keyboard. And

[SPEAKER_00] 40:07 - 40:13
 when I'm home, I'll just like be in whisper, using whisper, which is like this voice little thing

[SPEAKER_00] 40:13 - 40:18
 that you see right here. And it just translates speech to text really quickly. Sometimes it's not

[SPEAKER_00] 40:18 - 40:23
 that accurate. But so I'm just like switching, switching, and I'm just basically talking to it,

[SPEAKER_00] 40:23 - 40:28
 you know, just literally working as in multiple projects all at the same time. I think my

[SPEAKER_00] 40:28 - 40:32
 bottleneck right now is really how much context switching I can do in my head. So yeah,

[SPEAKER_00] 40:32 - 40:37
 another thing is enabling notifications, you could tell clock code to change the notifications, right?

[SPEAKER_00] 40:38 - 40:43
 You could just say change the notification to ring a little sound when you finish execution,

[SPEAKER_00] 40:43 - 40:50
 for example. And then when it's now, it will basically ring like a little notification. And

[SPEAKER_00] 40:50 - 40:58
 you could do a lot of things. At one point I had like, Texas speech, where like reads a summary of

[SPEAKER_00] 40:59 - 41:04
 one of wherever it finished, it will read the summary. So I could be like, okay, I got to go back to

[SPEAKER_00] 41:04 - 41:10
 tab two and then go do something. But that was too much. So I disabled it gig work trees is another way

[SPEAKER_00] 41:10 - 41:15
 to do multiple code execution. So one of the bottlenecks that you'll see is if you have these

[SPEAKER_00] 41:15 - 41:20
 kind of like bunch of multiple instances, you'll soon realize if you're doing local development,

[SPEAKER_00] 41:20 - 41:26
 you won't be able to make code edits the same project, unless you use get work trees. And I'll add some

[SPEAKER_00] 41:26 - 41:31
 descriptions on how to use get work trees. But basically, it's a way to like clone multiple

[SPEAKER_00] 41:31 - 41:36
 instances of your code base and have like different forking branches. So you could have like, you could

[SPEAKER_00] 41:36 - 41:42
 work on like code, like executions in the same project. Slash Chrome is actually a really cool

[SPEAKER_00] 41:42 - 41:50
 tool, in my opinion. So the way you get to it is by just doing slash Chrome like this, and then it'll go to

[SPEAKER_00] 41:50 - 41:55
 like slash Chrome, and then it will open this thing, you can't see it here. But there's like a little

[SPEAKER_00] 41:55 - 42:05
 button, and it just opens it and you could actually navigate the browser. So go to tip number 46.

[SPEAKER_00] 42:06 - 42:11
 So what it does is we'll look at the website and we'll and you can approve the plan, you could allow

[SPEAKER_00] 42:11 - 42:17
 the action. But basically, it will create the plan and they will like, do it, okay, it doesn't it doesn't

[SPEAKER_00] 42:17 - 42:27
 really know how to do it. So I'll say hit, let's just try YouTube. I think YouTube might be easier.

[SPEAKER_00] 42:28 - 42:39
 Okay, so we'll open YouTube and then say, find a video on cooking, for example. Yep.

[SPEAKER_00] 42:39 - 42:48
 So you can see that it like takes a screenshot, it will like click, it'll type cooking, and then it

[SPEAKER_00] 42:48 - 42:55
 will like, find cooking videos, for example. And then so I use this whenever I don't have API access

[SPEAKER_00] 42:55 - 43:03
 to certain things, but I can get there via my web. And because you could control it via slash Chrome,

[SPEAKER_00] 43:03 - 43:10
 you can have it as part, like I mentioned that all of these are composable. So you can have a command

[SPEAKER_00] 43:10 - 43:17
 that goes to Chrome, scrapes bunch of stuff, and comes back to you with the data. Okay, so moving on,

[SPEAKER_00] 43:17 - 43:22
 like I mentioned, it's really good for a powerful, like debugging, right, you can navigate the web with

[SPEAKER_00] 43:22 - 43:27
 it. That's also part of the validation thing that I was talking about, you can fill out forms and stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 43:27 - 43:32
 All right, hooks and automation is really just like kind of the cherry on top. And this is very

[SPEAKER_00] 43:32 - 43:40
 similar to like, get ups, pre hooks, and get ups, like posts, like commit stuff, like recommit stuff.

[SPEAKER_00] 43:40 - 43:48
 So basically, these are hooks. And as you can tell, it's just like, something to do before you start

[SPEAKER_00] 43:48 - 43:54
 executing or after executing. And after executing fails, like, there's all these things that you can

[SPEAKER_00] 43:54 - 43:59
 do. And you shouldn't manually do this, you should just ask Claude to, like, add these for you, you

[SPEAKER_00] 43:59 - 44:05
 know, like, go back to that principle that you're no longer main manually maintaining your work

[SPEAKER_00] 44:05 - 44:13
 environment. And a good example on what to put here for the post tool use is like, you know, things like

[SPEAKER_00] 44:14 - 44:20
 arc, like linting and formatting your code and things like that. And I'm not really using this yet. But

[SPEAKER_00] 44:20 - 44:27
 basically, this is really good if you want to block like, removing your entire like database or

[SPEAKER_00] 44:27 - 44:33
 something like that. It's just like good, good to prevent very destructive things. I haven't really

[SPEAKER_00] 44:33 - 44:38
 set it up because, you know, I have like, remote backups. And also, this is like side projects. But

[SPEAKER_00] 44:38 - 44:45
 for real world, you probably want something. And finally, with that, I think you got the vast majority

[SPEAKER_00] 44:45 - 44:52
 of like, the best tips that I know for clock code. The last thing I'll leave it with you is to explore

[SPEAKER_00] 44:52 - 44:59
 the like the plugin ecosystem. All the plugin is, is a just a combination of any of these composable

[SPEAKER_00] 44:59 - 45:04
 things that I talked about, like a skill that triggers an MCP that triggers like sub agents or

[SPEAKER_00] 45:04 - 45:10
 something like that. Or maybe there's like a bash script that's attached to a skill that can all be

[SPEAKER_00] 45:10 - 45:14
 turned into a plugin. And then a lot of people share their plugins online.

[SPEAKER_00] 45:14 - 45:19
 So this is like a really good example, you know, Anthropic has our own like plugins,

[SPEAKER_00] 45:19 - 45:23
 like structure, and they have a bunch of plugins here that you could download, for example,

[SPEAKER_00] 45:25 - 45:31
 like Colin ISP and things like that. So that's basically it. And the last thing I want to say

[SPEAKER_00] 45:31 - 45:38
 is context is king, you got to keep it fresh, keep it relevant, you essentially need to give

[SPEAKER_00] 45:38 - 45:48
 cod the context that it needs and nothing more. But yeah, so go and build something amazing. I hope this

[SPEAKER_00] 45:48 - 45:54
 was valuable to you. I hope you learned something, go and build something amazing. And if you're interested

[SPEAKER_00] 45:54 - 46:00
 in this kind of video on cloud cloud, I did a whole video on like kind of the high level thought process

[SPEAKER_00] 46:00 - 46:07
 of like AI coding, and and also talked a little bit about my second brain thing, those two videos are

[SPEAKER_00] 46:07 - 46:12
 right here to go and check it out. But yeah, until I see you guys on the next video. Bye.
